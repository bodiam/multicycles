    <h3>Providers</h3>

    <p>
      <nuxt-link to="/">Multicycles API</nuxt-link>&nbsp;implements many shared vehicle providers, such as bicycles with Mobike or Ofo, scooters with Bird and Lime, as well as scooters and cars.
      <br>A city does not include all providers.
      It may be interesting to ask the API which providers are available in the city.
